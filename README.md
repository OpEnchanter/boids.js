# Boids.js
This is a simple JavaScript library made for creating boids easily and quickly in web projects.

## How Boids Work
Boids function under 3 basic rules, seperation, alignment and cohesion. Seperation defines how each boid turns away from nearby boids, alignment defines how each boid aligns with the average direction of nearby boids and cohesion defines how boids move towards the center of nearby boids. These 3 basic rules make boids
have a flocking behavior that mimics how birds, fish and other animals move.
